# GeoTyper: Automated Pipeline from Raw scRNA-Seq Data to Cell Type Identification

GeoTyper is a standardized pipeline that integrates multiple scRNA-seq tools for processing raw sequence data extracted from NCBI GEO, visualization of results, statistical analysis, and cell type identification. This pipeline leverages existing tools, such as Cellranger from 10X Genomics, Alevin, and Seurat, to cluster cells and identify cell types based on gene expression profiles.

## Usage 

### 1. Importing Data from NCBI

1_input_fastq_dump.slurm

- Purpose: download FASTQ files from NCBI GEO and (optionally) split files into Read 1 (R1 → cell barcodes) and Read 2 (R2 → tagged cDNA)

- Directions: when submitting job list FASTQ SRA Run Selector Ascension Numbers after slurm file name

*$ in file signifies all variable names passed to file

- Ex. sbatch input_fastq_dump.slurm SRR14684940 SRR14684940 → runs for the first SRA file and then the second

**NOTE**: The names of the FASTQs generated by 1_input_fastq_dump.slurm MUST BE CHANGED. They must follow Illumina’s naming convention when using Cellranger and Alevin.
Naming convention:
- SampleName: sample ID
- S1: the sample number based on the order that samples are listed in the sample sheet (e.g., from each person)
- L001: lane number (reads 1 and 2 in the same lane)
- R1: the read → R1 means Read 1
- For paired-end runs, there is at least one R2 (read 2) file
- 001: last segment is always 001
Ex. output of 1_input_fastq_dump.slurm: SRR14684940_1.fastq.gz, SRR14684940_2.fastq.gz
- Rename to lymphoma_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz, lymphoma_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz


### 2. Implementing and running Cellranger Count or Alevin

#### Cellranger Count

2_input_cellranger_count.slurm

- Purpose: run Cellranger Count for paired FASTQ files (i.e., R1, R2) from 10X Genomics

- Output: barcodes.tsv.gz (cell barcodes → columns), features.tsv.gz (gene names → rows), matrix.mtx.gz (counts data)

Directions:
When submitting a job supply the following arguments after the slurm file name:
- Name of output directory to create (--id=$1 in slurm file)
- Path to directory with the FASTQs (--fastqs=$2 in slurm file)
- Path to samples to use in analysis, i.e., beginning of FASTQ names (--sample=$3 in slurm file)
- Path to transcriptome reference file / folder (--transcriptome=$4 in slurm file)
- Ex. sbatch input_cellranger_count.slurm run_count_lymphoma /project/Dolatshahi_Lab/MSDS/Clean_Final/cellranger_lymhoma/test test_sample1,test_sample2,test_sample3 /project/Dolatshahi_Lab/MSDS/Clean_Final/refdata-cellranger-GRCh38-3.0.0

Example: 
- Name of output directory: run_count_lymphoma
- Path to directory with FASTQs: /project/Dolatshahi_Lab/MSDS/Clean_Final/cellranger_lymhoma/test
- Path to samples to use in analysis: test_sample1,test_sample2,test_sample3 
- Path to transcriptome reference: /project/Dolatshahi_Lab/MSDS/Clean_Final/refdata-cellranger-GRCh38-3.0.0

#### Alevin

2_input_run_alevin.slurm

Purpose: run Alevin for paired FASTQ files (i.e., R1, R2) from Drop-seq, 10x-Chromium v1/2/3, inDropV2, CELSeq ½, Quartz-Seq2, sci-RNA-seq3

Output: quants_mat.gz (compressed count matrix), quants_mat_col.txt (gene IDs), quants_mat_row.txt (CBs, or cell barcodes), quants_tier_mat.gz (tier categorization of matrix)

txp2gene.tsv
- Purpose: reference transcriptome used for running alevin
- Directions: supply as the fourth argument on the command line when submitting 2_input_run_alevin.slurm

Directions:
- When submitting a job supply the following arguments after the slurm file name:
    - Path to the FASTQ file(s) containing the cell barcodes (CBs) and raw unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), i.e., Read 1 or R1 (-1 $1 in slurm file)
    - Path to the FASTQ file(s) containing the raw sequence reads, i.e., Read 2 or R2 (-2 $2 in slurm file)
    - Type of single-cell protocol of the input sequencing library, e.g., –dropseq, –chromium, –chromiumV3 (--$3 in slurm file)
    - Transcript to the gene map file, a tsv (tab-separated) file  → default the one provided in the Clean_Final folder, txp2gene.tsv (--tgMap $4)

Ex. sbatch 2_input_run_alevin.slurm /project/Dolatshahi_Lab/MSDS/Clean_Final/cellranger_lymphoma/test/test_sample1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz /project/Dolatshahi_Lab/MSDS/Clean_Final/cellranger_lymphoma/test/test_sample1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz chromiumV3 /project/Dolatshahi_Lab/MSDS/Clean_Final/geotyper/txp2gene.tsv


### 3. Downstream Analyses with knitted html or pdf output

3_input_R_to_pdf.slurm

Purpose: run an R script (e.g., with Seurat code) and output a PDF file (with plots only)

Directions:

- When submitting a job add the path to the R script(s) to convert to PDF after the slurm file name

- Ex. sbatch 3_input_R_to_pdf.slurm lymphoma.R

3_input_Rmd_to_html.slurm

Purpose: run an R script or .Rmd file and knit to an html file

Directions:

- When submitting a job supply the following arguments after the slurm file name:

- The path to the R script or .Rmd file (‘$1’ in slurm file)

- The desired name of the output html file (output_file=’$2’ in file file)

- Ex. sbatch 3_input_Rmd_to_html.slurm lymphoma.Rmd lymphoma_data.html

If you run into error about a package not installed in R: 
- Load R in the terminal in that folder: module load goolf/7.1.0_3.1.4 R/4.1.1
- Type “R” and hit enter
- Install the package as you normally would in RStudio (e.g., install.packages(‘package_name’))
- Type “quit()” to quit

Some of the packages we’ve discovered not yet installed: 
- install.packages(‘devtools’)
- library(biocmanager) → biocmanager::install(‘singleR’)

alevin_cell_type_id_methods.Rmd
- Purpose: all cell type identification methods except ACTINN (Seurat with canonical markers if applicable, Seurat and PanglaoDB, SingleR, scCATCH) for feature-barcode matrix files generated by Alevin

cellranger_cell_type_id_methods.Rmd
- Purpose: all cell type identification methods except ACTINN (Seurat with canonical markers if applicable, Seurat and PanglaoDB, SingleR, scCATCH) for feature-barcode matrix files generated by Cellranger count

immune_marker.csv 
- Purpose: the csv file extracted from PanglaoDB contains information such as gene markers, cell type names, etc. for identifying cell types with the PanglaoDB method
